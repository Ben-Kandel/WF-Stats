# This directory contains the front end for this project.

The client is written using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

Currently, the front end is not hosted anywhere. It is only accessible via a local development server.

ChartJS is the library I use for visualizing data.

The HTML is written by hand and is quite simple.
The CSS is written with the help of SASS.

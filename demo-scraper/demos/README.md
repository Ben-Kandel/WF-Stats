# This directory contains .wdz20 files.

### Note
For now, .wdz20 files are not automatically unzipped. You have to do this manually.
Just extract your .wdz20 files into this directory and everything will work.
So, for now, populate this directory with your extracted .wdz20 files (and not the .wdz20 files themselves)

There is no required naming scheme. All files with the .wdz20 extension will be read.
